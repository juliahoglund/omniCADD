This script takes as input the preporcessed maf files,
the ancestor sequence of interest and returns per .maf file (per chromosome) the ancestor sequence in fasta format.

:Usage: python extract_ancestor.py <file> <Ancestor identifier> <scientific name> <fai file>

:Example:
python scripts/extract_ancestor.py output/dir_mS/mS_chr19 chr19 Ancestor_Mouse_Rat mus_musculus Mus_Musculus.fai

Added:
1) It removes ancestral sequences that are not of the same length as stated in their annotation.
2) It checks whenever the start position of the to be added sub sequence is located in the previous added sub sequence.
	If true, this sequence will be skipped.

Needs to be looped, because it only takes one chr.maf file
Solved with this script: 'wrapper_extract_ancestor.py'
