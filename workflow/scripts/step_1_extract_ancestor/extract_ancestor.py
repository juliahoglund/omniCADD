This script takes as input the preprocessed maf file, the ancestor sequence
of interest and returns per .maf file (per chromosome) the ancestor sequence
in fasta format.

Added: 1) It removes ancestral sequences that are not of the same length as
stated in their annotation. 2) It checks whenever the start position of the
to be added sub sequence is located in the previous added sub sequence. If
true, this sequence will be skipped.
