# omniCADD
#### a CADD scoring system to asses variant deleteriousness in non-model organisms
----

This is where the updates for the CADD pipeline generalised to be able to acore more than one species will end up.
As it is still in its starting phase, it is privated and will be updated on the go.

The parts of the workflow can be found in the directory *workflow*, where the steps are separated in subdirectories. to each step there is an accompanying `snakefile` that can be fun either alone, or as a part of the full pipeline with the `Snakefile` here in the main folder.
